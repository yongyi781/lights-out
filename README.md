# lights-out

This is a simple [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) solver I made in WPF.

In fact, the name is a misnomer, because I am not actually solving the proper Lights Out game. Instead, I'm solving a variant where you are allowed to force squares, and the objective is to minimize the number of total actions. The inspiration for this variant is simply the [Runecrafting tiles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dungeoneering/Puzzles#Flip_tiles) puzzle in dungeoneering, which is a ~~minigame~~ skill in RuneScape (released in 2010).
